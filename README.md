# RRRControl
A simple Car Data Controller for Race Room Racing Experience

## Why.

I'm in love with cars. And computer programming. So is not hard to understand why I'm doing this thing.

## Why II

Because like every pilot (yeah, virtual pilot indeed) i hate to lose. And you know, every part of a car is important; brakes,tires,clutch and every part of your car must be used in the perfect range for his specs.

Probably, if you like racing game and you hate to lose like me, You want something to understand the behavior of your car at the best. Data gives to you this possibility.

## How

I'm not a c# programmer, so probably (surely) you can find any type of error in this repository, like: Typo, Bad English, Errated constructs, Antipatterns.

For me is not important, i like very much this project only because help me to do my best in track.

## Inspiration

This repo uses, and be inspired by the Demo project of [Race Room Sample API](https://github.com/sector3studios/r3e-api)
